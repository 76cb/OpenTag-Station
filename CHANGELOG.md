# Changelog

## 1.0.0-rc.2

- Standalone WT32 selection from My Spools, My Filaments, or Community; physical
  spool creation, import/reuse, exact writer review, and reassignment without a prior clear.
- Shared tag lifecycle: compatible blanks offer Assign; successful cleanup offers
  immediate reuse. Existing remote ownership and NFC safety fences remain mandatory.
- Full-screen text, numeric, URL and password input with 44 px keys, explicit acceptance,
  cancel, and repeat backspace. Bounded inventory pages and streaming gzip Community search.
- Explicit production version changes enforced in PR CI. Physical touch comfort,
  real-network Community timing and complete standalone appliance acceptance remain pending.

# 1.0.0

**Unreleased; acceptance pending.** The current candidate is derived from `VERSION`.
No final 1.0.0 release or tag has been published by this change.

- Current-spool dashboard, responsive inventory, explicit Weigh, printer assignment,
  tag management, Community import, and organized settings in the browser.
- Five touch views for the WT32-SC01 Plus, with large actions and shared spool state.
- Guarded NXP ICODE SLIX2 OpenPrintTag writing, readback, recovery journaling,
  Clear / Reuse, and verified Spoolman identity cleanup.
- NAU7802/YZC-133 calibration, tare, stability, and explicit measurement receipts.
  Spoolman auto-update after explicit Weigh is off by default.
- Spoolman remains canonical; FilaBridge maps Prusa XL T1–T5 with confirmation
  and exact backend readback. Destructive requests are never silently replayed.
- Browser Wi-Fi setup, optional local API authentication, configuration backup,
  and local A/B OTA with recovery safeguards.
- Production-only USB web installer, reproducible version/provenance checks,
  tag-triggered release packaging, and a separate hardware/user/developer manual.
- Sanitized product fixtures and guarded screenshot publication.

Final visual, live integration, physical tag/scale/touch, stability, and recovery
acceptance remains required. See [the release checklist](docs/releasing.md).
